# Payment Gateway Integration

A project aimed at creating a website with a donation gateway. I've used Razorpay as my payment gateway. 

## Initial Steps:

* Create a Razorpay account.
* Enable KYC.
* Go to the 'Payment Button' tab and follow the creation procedures.
* You will get a snippet of a code that can be directly pasted in your script.

## Some extremely helpful articles which helped me throughout the project:
